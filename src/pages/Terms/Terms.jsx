                    We may modify this Agreement from time to time and such modifications shall be effective upon posting on the Services. You will be deemed to have agreed to any such modifications by your further use of the Services after any such modification is posted.

                    You may never use another's Account without permission. You may not create more than one Account. You are prohibited from registering a new Account if you have previously had an Account terminated.
                    You are responsible for (i) keeping confidential any password that you created to use any aspect of the Services requiring registration, and (ii) restricting access to your computer, console, or mobile device. You agree to accept full responsibility for all activities that occur within your Account. You must notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account.
                    Although we will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your Account, whether with or without your knowledge, you may be liable for our losses or the losses of our third-party licensors, content providers, merchants, advertisers, sponsors, and service providers (collectively, “WORLD WAR NEXT Providers") due to such unauthorized use.
                    Without limiting anything in this Agreement, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate your Account and/or your access to any or all parts of the Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, and without liability, including in the event we stop offering any aspect of the Services.

You agree not to use the Service for any other purpose.
                    As referenced above, even though you may buy Virtual Items with “real-world” money, you do not, in fact, “own” such items.  By making such a purchase, you are merely being granted a license to use such Virtual Items in the applicable Apps or other Services for which such Virtual Items can be used.  The Virtual Items have no real-world value and are not in any way a credit or balance of real currency or its equivalent.  In no event can any Virtual Items be redeemed for actual “real-world” currency. We have the sole and absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Items as we see fit in our sole discretion, and shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights.
